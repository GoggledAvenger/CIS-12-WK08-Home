Hello,

I think I understand how your provided code is meant to work. It approaches the program differently than I had
originally set it up, so I am having a hard time combining the code. I know I need to create a way to get my return
values saved into lists so they can be "saved" for later use (i.e. #3 Dump Encrypted Text). However, several
attempts to do this were unsuccessful. So I am again turning in a program that only sort of works. which() works
okay, apart from the printing of menu item 3. The code you provided which I played around with also sort of works,
but has some IndexError issues, probably because I modified it to be closer to what I had initially been trying to
do. Essentially I asked the user for their own keyword, whereas your code provided its own keyword. I know setting
my original program up with lists would be more efficient, especially for the printing stored data feature, but I
currently do not have to vocabulary to do what is in my head. Perhaps if next lab doesn't take as much time as this
one, we can sit down and work something out.
